         * You must have been watching us at some point. Following us.
         * People split, sure. Not everything was meant to be.
         * The question is; how vicious was that moment?
         * What supreme experience could destroy so much?
         * A punch? A spit? A word? No, something worse.
         * There are hints. So many hints. I'm good at keeping a secret.
         * You can't be sure can you? You've ran the simulations but there is always
         * a nag. a doubt. There lies something powerful.
